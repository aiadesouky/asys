Linux Config Files
==================
==================

System Administration
=====================
/etc/nologin		Prevents specified users from logging in, often used for system maintenance messages.
/etc/rpmrc			Configuration file for the RPM package manager that specifies global RPM settings.
/etc/securetty		Lists terminals (TTYs) from which root (superuser) is allowed to log in directly.
/etc/usertty		Specifies which terminals user accounts are allowed to use.
/etc/passwd			The passwd file contains a list of user accounts and the corresponding user ID, group ID, home directory, and the default shell. It is readable by most users, but only root and sudo accounts can add new users or remove and modify existing user data.
/etc/group			The group file contains a list of user groups. Each line in the file represents a group and displays the group name, GID, and group members. Administrators can interact with this file to manage settings for an entire collection of users.
/etc/sudoers		The sudoers file specifies which users have elevated permissions, on which machines, and for which directories. Admins can use this file to configure permissions for users and groups to use the sudo command.
/etc/shadow			The shadow file stores encrypted user password information and other password-related data such as the password expiration date, last change date, and account expiration date. It is only accessible by the root user or users with appropriate privileges. The restricted access and encryption add another security layer compared to the /etc/passwd file.
/etc/gshadow		The gshadow file stores encrypted user group password information and other password-related data such as the password expiration date, last change date, and account expiration date. Like the shadow file, it is only accessible by the root user or users with appropriate privileges.
/etc/skel			The skel directory contains default configuration scripts and templates such as .bashrc and bash_profile. The templates are copied to the user's home directory when a new user is created, streamlining the provisioning of new user accounts.
/etc/login.defs		The login.defs file contains system-wide user account policy settings, like the password aging policy. System administrators can refer to and modify this file to enforce specific security and user management rules.
